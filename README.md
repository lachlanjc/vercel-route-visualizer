# Vercel Route Visualizer

This is a [Remix](https://remix.run) project for visualizing how the pages of your Vercel sites have evolved over time.
Itâ€™s super early-days, with a bare-bones design and no real features. More to come!

## Getting started

First, get a [token for your Vercel account](https://vercel.com/account/tokens), and set the `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` environment variable to it.

Then, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

To start the dev server:

```
yarn dev
```

After you've started the dev server you can access it by going to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To build the app:

```
yarn build
```
